# SSCJ
A spread spectrum communication system using Kasami Code, uses QPSK and BPSK and works on a imaginary 60GHz channel. 

Files: 
##spread.m 
The matlab code for generating a random sequence, Kasami Code, doing BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) and QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) modulation, adding noise and channel effects and printing the Bit Error Rate graphs.  

##MMSE_eq.m
The matlab code for MMSE equaliser

##ch_coeff.mat
Imaginary channel coefficent values for the 60GHz channel used

##Old Try
Contains earlier version of the codes to achieve the same task as spread.m . Includes a folder containg code to generate kasami sequence.
